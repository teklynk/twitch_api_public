<h1>Get started</h1>
<p>
    This is a way to run your own Twitch API "gate-way" service that only requires the user name/channel name to pull data. It acts as a public gateway to Twitch's API. This is useful when creating your own Twitch tools/apps and just want to get data from Twitch without passing in your client id and auth token into your code and manually refreshing your auth token every 3 months. Auth token automatically refreshes on the server every day. All requests use GET to pull data. Nothing is posted back to Twitch and nothing is stored on the server. Once set up, getting data from Twitch is as simple as going to a URL and parsing the returned JSON string.
